# ACID Compliance Verification Guide

This guide explains how to verify that your Bounties and Berries application follows ACID principles.

## üéØ What is ACID?

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions:

- **A**tomicity: All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together
- **C**onsistency: Data remains in a valid state before and after transactions
- **I**solation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **D**urability: Committed transactions survive system failures

## üîç How to Verify ACID Compliance

### 1. **Automated Testing** (Recommended)

Run the automated ACID compliance tests:

```bash
# Run comprehensive ACID tests
node scripts/run-acid-tests.js

# Run manual verification
node scripts/verify-acid.js
```

### 2. **Manual Verification Steps**

#### **Step 1: Check Atomicity**
```sql
-- Check for incomplete transactions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_bounty_participation WHERE status IS NULL;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_reward_claim urc
LEFT JOIN "user" u ON urc.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN reward r ON urc.reward_id = r.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL OR r.id IS NULL;
```

#### **Step 2: Check Consistency**
```sql
-- Check for negative berry balances
SELECT u.name, 
       COALESCE(SUM(ubp.berries_earned), 0) - COALESCE(SUM(urc.berries_spent), 0) as net_balance
FROM "user" u
LEFT JOIN user_bounty_participation ubp ON u.id = ubp.user_id AND ubp.status = 'completed'
LEFT JOIN user_reward_claim urc ON u.id = urc.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
HAVING (COALESCE(SUM(ubp.berries_earned), 0) - COALESCE(SUM(urc.berries_spent), 0)) < 0;

-- Check for duplicate participations
SELECT user_id, bounty_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM user_bounty_participation 
GROUP BY user_id, bounty_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### **Step 3: Check Isolation**
```sql
-- Check for race condition indicators
SELECT user_id, reward_id, COUNT(*) as claim_count
FROM user_reward_claim
GROUP BY user_id, reward_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### **Step 4: Check Durability**
```sql
-- Check data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM "user";
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_participations FROM user_bounty_participation;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_claims FROM user_reward_claim;
```

### 3. **Production Monitoring**

Use the ACID monitor in production:

```javascript
const acidMonitor = require('./utils/acidMonitor');

// Monitor critical operations
const result = await acidMonitor.monitorTransaction('reward_claim', async () => {
  return await userRewardClaimService.claimReward(userId, rewardId, createdBy);
});

// Check metrics
const metrics = acidMonitor.getMetrics();
console.log('ACID Metrics:', metrics);
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Reward Claiming**
**Test**: Multiple users try to claim the same limited reward simultaneously
**Expected**: Only one user succeeds, others get "insufficient berries" or "reward not available"
**ACID Principle**: Isolation, Consistency

### **Scenario 2: Bounty Registration**
**Test**: User tries to register for the same bounty multiple times
**Expected**: First registration succeeds, subsequent attempts fail with "duplicate participation"
**ACID Principle**: Atomicity, Consistency

### **Scenario 3: Berry Balance Calculation**
**Test**: User completes bounties and claims rewards
**Expected**: Net berries = earned - spent, never negative
**ACID Principle**: Consistency

### **Scenario 4: Concurrent Updates**
**Test**: Two admins update the same bounty simultaneously
**Expected**: One succeeds, other gets "concurrent modification" error
**ACID Principle**: Isolation

## üìä Monitoring Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure ACID compliance:

```javascript
{
  transactions: 1000,        // Total transactions
  rollbacks: 5,             // Failed transactions
  deadlocks: 2,             // Isolation violations
  violations: 7,            // Total ACID violations
  violationRate: "0.7%",    // Violation percentage
  rollbackRate: "0.5%"      // Rollback percentage
}
```

## üö® Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators of ACID violations:

1. **Negative berry balances**
2. **Duplicate participations or claims**
3. **Orphaned records**
4. **High rollback rates**
5. **Deadlock errors**
6. **Inconsistent data between related tables**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: High Rollback Rate**
```javascript
// Check for constraint violations
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = 'your_database';
```

#### **Issue 2: Deadlocks**
```javascript
// Monitor deadlock frequency
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```

#### **Issue 3: Data Inconsistency**
```javascript
// Run consistency checks
await acidMonitor.verifyConsistency();
```

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Run ACID checks daily
2. **Automated Alerts**: Set up alerts for violations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track transaction performance
4. **Backup Verification**: Ensure backups maintain ACID properties
5. **Load Testing**: Test under high concurrent load

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your application follows ACID principles when:

- ‚úÖ No negative berry balances
- ‚úÖ No duplicate participations or claims
- ‚úÖ All transactions complete atomically
- ‚úÖ Concurrent operations don't interfere
- ‚úÖ Data survives system restarts
- ‚úÖ Rollback rate < 1%
- ‚úÖ No deadlock errors in production

## üìù Verification Checklist

- [ ] Run automated ACID tests
- [ ] Check for data consistency
- [ ] Monitor transaction performance
- [ ] Verify concurrent operation handling
- [ ] Test system recovery
- [ ] Review error logs for violations
- [ ] Validate backup integrity

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter ACID violations:

1. Check the error logs for specific violations
2. Run the verification scripts to identify issues
3. Review the transaction code for potential race conditions
4. Consider adding additional locking mechanisms
5. Consult the database logs for deadlock information
