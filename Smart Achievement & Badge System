## **6. Achievement Logic Details**

### **6.1 Points-Based Achievement Logic**
```
For each user:
1. Sum all points_earned from user_bounty_participation
2. Compare total to achievement thresholds
3. Award all achievements where total >= threshold
4. Calculate progress toward next achievement level
```

### **6.2 Activity-Based Achievement Logic**
```
For each user:
1. Group participation by bounty_type (coding, design, writing, etc.)
2. Calculate points per activity type
3. Calculate percentage of total points per activity
4. Award specialization if percentage >= 60% and total_points >= 1000
```

### **6.3 Special Badge Logic**
```
For each user:
1. Check for first bounty completion
2. Identify perfect score achievements
3. Calculate completion streaks
4. Award badges based on unique accomplishments
```
